Install notes:

    # for developing (working directly in source dir):
    # for Mac, doesn't work on Windows
    #   this adds the source dir path to site-packages/easy-install.pth
    sudo python setup.py develop  

    # alternate (for Win): copies these files to site-packages
    # must rerun after every change to source files
    sudo python setup.py install -f
